Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to 
which it is applied. Fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests 
such as database connections, URLs to test and some sort of input data. 
Therefore, instead of running the same code for every test, 
we can attach fixture function to the tests and it will run and 
return the data to the test before executing each test.

A fixture function defined inside a test file has a scope within the test file only. 
We cannot use that fixture in another test file. 
To make a fixture available to multiple test files, 
we have to define the fixture function in a file called conftest.py.

The tests will look for fixture in the same file. As the fixture is not found in the file, 
it will check for fixture in conftest.py file. On finding it, 
the fixture method is invoked and the result is returned to the input argument of the test.

The syntax to stop the execution of test suite soon after n number of test fails is as follows âˆ’

pytest --maxfail = <num>

"""1. Fixture with yield:
The setup_teardown fixture uses yield to separate setup and teardown code.
The code before yield is executed before the test function.
The code after yield is executed after the test function finishes.
2. Test using the fixture:
The test_example function takes the setup_teardown fixture as an argument. This automatically triggers the fixture's execution.

Scope
Function Scope: Fresh setup for each test function.
Class Scope: Shared setup for all tests in a class.
Module Scope: Shared setup for all tests in a module.
Session Scope: Shared setup for all tests in a session
